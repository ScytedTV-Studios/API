In order to access certain information via our API, you must use an API token in your `GET` or `POST` requests. Each App must have its own API key, which is resetable via the [dashboard](https://api.scyted.tv/dashboard) using the username and password provided upon signup. Since each app has its own API keys, each key is given access to certain endpoints with their own rate limits.

**Sign Up:**

In order to sign up to receive an API key, you must either DM `@loydosborne` on Discord, or email `api@scyted.tv` with the following information:

* The Name of your app.
* The intended use of your API access.
* What you need access to and how (`Read` or `Write`).

**Using the ScytedTV API for your own App(s):**

You might also be interested in using the ScytedTV API for your own apps to store basic information (such as user info for Discord bots, etc.). If you would like to do so, please clarify that in your Sign-up request.
